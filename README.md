**QR Code Generator** 

A QR code generator built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript allows users to create QR codes directly in their web browser. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

**Functionality:**
* Users enter text or a URL in an input field.
* Clicking a button triggers a Javascript function.
* Javascript converts the entered data into a QR code using a QR code generation library. 
* The generated QR code is then displayed as an image on the webpage.

**Benefits:**
* Creates QR codes without external software.
* Convenient and user-friendly.

**Things to Consider:**
